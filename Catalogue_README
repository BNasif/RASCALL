README file on the RASCALL Catalogue
----------------------------------


The folder “Molecular_Data” contains spectral information about 16,367 molecules. Within it there are subfolders with the name of each molecule in SMILE format [REF SMILE]. In each molecule’s folder there are two files, one containing the RASCALL skeleton spectra data (see below for details and units) and one with the functional group information of the molecule.

Please be advised that the RASCALL catalogue of molecular spectra presented here is a preliminary database. Before using the  RASCALL data as molecular input for spectra simulations you are advised to contact the first author, Clara Sousa-Silva (cssilva@mit.edu), for technical support and clarification.

Usage note: To avoid folder path issues, any molecule with a SMILE code containing a forward slash symbol (“/“) has been renamed to replace “/” with the string “fslash”, eg CH/[H]C/[Se] is CHfslash[H]Cfslash[Se].

[SMILE}.txt
===========
File listing all functional groups identified in the molecule, as well as their associated properties and sources. All columns are separated by a comma and a single white space.

Column 1: Functional group represented in SMILE notation, e.g. ‘[H]\\C([!#1])=C(/[H])[!#1]’
Column 2: Specific symmetry type of the functional group, also known as the vibrational mode, e.g. ’stretch’
Column 3: Average predicted position of the functional group symmetry, in units of wavenumbers (cm-1).
Column 4: Qualitative intensities converted to numerical values ranging from 1 (representing a “weak” spectral feature) to 3 (representing a “weak” spectral feature).
Column 5: Experimental, theoretical or literature source for the functional group information. Full citations can be found in the associated article.

[SMILE}_RASCALL.txt
=================

File containing the estimated position and intensities of the molecule’s band centers. All columns are separated by a single white space.

Column 1: Approximate position in units of wavenumbers (cm-1).
Column 2: Qualitative intensities in values from 1 to 3 (see above).
